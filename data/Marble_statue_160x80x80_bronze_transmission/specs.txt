Simulation setup

    Simulation was run with GEANT4 v10.07 software (https://geant4.web.cern.ch/)

    Muon source

    - CRY cosmic muon source (https://nuclear.llnl.gov/simulation/doc_cry_v1.7/cry.pdf)
    - 4m2 horizontal generation surface, placed directly above the object of interest
    - 5 million generated muons, corresponding to ~8h of data taking.

    Object of interest

    - Statue made of marble (rho = 2.71 g.cm-3), containing a 20cm diameter cylinder made of bronze

    Detector

    - 3 infinitly thin detectors, recording the true muon position
    - Panels are placed below the object

    Trigger

    - Only muons crossing the 3 detector planes are recorded.
