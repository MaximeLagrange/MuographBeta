Simulation setup

    Simulation was run with GEANT4 v10.07 software (https://geant4.web.cern.ch/)

    Muon source

    - CRY cosmic muon source (https://nuclear.llnl.gov/simulation/doc_cry_v1.7/cry.pdf)
    - 1m2 horizontal generation surface
    - 1 million generated muons

    Object of interest

    - Barrel made of iron, containing cubes of uranium, lead and iron
    - Cubes of uranium, lead and iron.are also placed outside of the barrel for comparison.

    Detector

    - 6 infinitly thin detectors, recording the true muon position
    - 3 panels above, 3 panels below the object
